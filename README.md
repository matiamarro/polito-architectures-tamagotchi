# Tamagotchi for Landriger NXP LPC1768
In Keil Î¼Vision, with the use of the LANDTIGER emulator implementing a Tamagotchi!

Some requirements:
- tamagotchi animation
- two life status bar 'Happiness' and 'Saziety' that decrement 1 point periodically and increment if the tamagotchi is 'cuddled' or 'feeded'
- joystick implementation to select the food to give and eating animation
- dying animation when one of the two lifebar goes to zero
- cuddle animation when tamagotchi is touch from the touch display
- some sounds, little melodies to play during animations with the volume control through the potentiometer
